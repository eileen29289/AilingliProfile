      <h1>7 Thai Restaurants in Columbia</h1>
      <p>The Thai restaurant mainly serves Thai food, which is usually called Thai cuisine. Traditional Thai cuisine loosely falls into four categories: tom (boiled dishes), yam (spicy salads), tam(pounded foods), and kaeng (curries). Deep-frying, stir-frying and steaming are methods introduced from Chinese cuisine. Thai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with strong aromatic components and a spicy edge.</p>

					<p>It has the same owner as Chims Thai Kitchen on Broadway, and its web page is also kind of bad. It has customers' comments and gallery, but I strongly suggest they change how they put the section and leave the home page cleaner. The menu sounds good though.</p>
